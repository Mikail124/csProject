On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 31.03.2020 ~
This week, I completed the UX design of the project and designed the pages from photoshop by myself.

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~
This week, I decided how to code the project and which systems to use. So I started watching videos on the internet about Android Studio and Firebase database systems.
### ~ 22.04.2020 ~
Today, we did a division of work with my teammates. I will make the login page, sign-up page, database system and homepages of the mobile application.
### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
Today, I transferred the interfaces of the login page, sign-up page to android studio. It wasn't as easy as I did in Photoshop. Then I made the links between the pages and made the buttons clickable. Finally, I created the database system via Firebase. I used an internet based database system.
