On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 31.03.2020 ~
This week, I completed the UX design of the project and designed the pages from photoshop by myself.

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~
This week, I decided how to code the project and which systems to use. So I started watching videos on the internet about Android Studio and Firebase database systems.
### ~ 22.04.2020 ~
Today, we did a division of work with my teammates. I will make the login page, sign-up page, database system and homepages of the mobile application.
### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
Today, I transferred the interfaces of the login page, sign-up page to android studio. It wasn't as easy as I did in Photoshop. Then I made the links between the pages and made the buttons clickable. Finally, I created the database system via Firebase. I used an internet based database system.
### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
Today, I transferred the interface of the feed screens from photoshop to android studio. I also took care of the transfer of information between pages. So after today, I will be able to use the information I get from the user (name, surname, department) anywhere in the application.
### ~ 05.05.2020 ~
Today, I transferred the interface of the profile screen from photoshop to android studio. Now, the user can access the profile page and view their information completely after logging into the application. Also, I wrote all the detailed design report by myself.
### ~ 17.05.2020 ~
Today, I completed the part that the user can change their profile photos. I created the storage of the application and if the the user change their profile photo, photo will be uploaded to the firebase storage and will be stored it here.
### ~ 18.05.2020 ~
Today, I corrected bugs in transitions between the pages of the application. Also, I helped Arda to create the 'createeventpage' class. After creating the class, I overcome posting the information that I received the from 'createeventpage' class on the feed pages. Although I do almost everything(design, reports, coding) on my own, I approach to the end of the project.
