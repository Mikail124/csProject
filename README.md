## Project Description
_In Bilkent University, there are a few places that we can see the announcements of club events and researches such as BAIS, STARS, and wallpapers. However, students don’t like reading such a tedious list of activities through BAIS mails or STARS. They can only see these activi-ties on wall announcements in certain department buildings here and almost every time they do not even read these announcements. Therefore, students can miss events and may not complete GE250/1 points. Besides, they may not do their interested out-lesson activities, so they may not learn any skills except their major lessons and they are not enjoyed in university. Thus, it would be better if students read these activities from their phones without having to log in to their STARS or mail accounts. We are developing the BiAct app that shows upcom-ing activities, seminars and researches from wanted clubs, departments and research center lists. The target aim of this app is to provide a more easily tracked list of events such as semi-nars, club activities and researches, in Bilkent University created by clubs, research centers and departments with making the environment where users are interacting with each other via message and adding friend facilities. We are expecting this app is used by not only all Bilkent University students but also the academic staff of the university._
